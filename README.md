# Hello, my name is Jose
### Cross-Platform App Development student
> After 12 years working in the plumbing and HVAC industry, I am on an exciting transition process from a strong management and technical background to getting back on the path of my true calling: programming. That's the reason why I decided two years ago to take advantage of my previous experience in Industrial Electronics and start on a study program to become a developer. During this period, I have acquired a solid knowledge of programming languages, such as Java or SQL, and I am currently training in Python with the aim of deepening the development in the field of Machine Learning.
>
>My main focus right now is to gain hands-on experience and eventually get to collaborate on challenging projects, where I can expand my skills and knowledge. My experience in administrative and technical environments has provided me with valuable perspective, as well as effective communication, time management and problem solving skills with a practical and original mindset and approach.

 *So please be patient...*
